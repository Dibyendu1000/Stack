# Stack
In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which 
adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed

1) The first program is a primitive Stack which pushes data from rear end as well as pops from rear end
2) The second program is a implementation of Stack to record student data ( Name, class and roll)
